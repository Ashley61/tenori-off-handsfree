tenori-off

## What is this?

A [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenori-on) >Tenori-on</a> is a dope electronic music
instrument that Yamaha made for a hot minute. It's a fancy "sequencer", I'm told. 
I don't particularly like electronic music,
but I love pixels and patterns and generating things out of pixels and patterns. This means
I <b>love</b> the Tenori-on. However, I have never seen one in real life, and they're
kind of <a href="https://reverb.com/item/11642149-yamaha-tenori-on">expensive</a> so I made 
a shitty JavaScript version of what I think it kind of looks like, since I don't
aaaaactually know.

You can change between drums or a synth sound, and send the
url to a pal to have them listen to your masterpiece. It prolly has bugs so uhh, refresh when you're stuck.

Ok, go make fun shit now!
