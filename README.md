=================
## What is this?

A ✨[Tenori-on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenori-on)✨ is a dope electronic music
instrument sequencer thinkie that Yamaha made for a hot minute.  
I don't particularly like electronic music,
but I love pixels and patterns and generating things out of pixels and patterns, which means
I **LOVE** the Tenori-on

owever, I have never seen one in real life, and they're
kind of [expensive](https://reverb.com/item/11642149-yamaha-tenori-on) so I made 
a shitty JavaScript version of what I think it kind of looks like, since I don't
aaaaactually know.

You can change between drums or a synth sound (also using the **D** or **S** keys). The URL also holds the state, so you can send it to a pal to have them listen to your masterpiece. If you hit a bug, refreshing usually makes it go away.

### Ok, go make fun shit now!
