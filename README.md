## What is this?

A [Tenori-on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenori-on) is a dope electronic music
instrument that Yamaha made for a hot minute. It's a fancy "sequencer", I'm told. 

I don't particularly like electronic music,
but I love pixels and patterns and generating things out of pixels and patterns. This means
I **love** the Tenori-on. However, I have never seen one in real life, and they're
kind of [expensive](https://reverb.com/item/11642149-yamaha-tenori-on) so I made 
a shitty JavaScript version of what I think it kind of looks like, since I don't
aaaaactually know.

You can change between drums or a synth sound, and send the
url to a pal to have them listen to your masterpiece. It prolly has bugs so uhh, refresh when you're stuck.

### Ok, go make fun shit now!
